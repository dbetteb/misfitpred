Purpose

Provides data necessary to create a neural network model to predict lattice
mismatch in nickel-based superalloys.

 

Description

Superalloys based on nickel have superior performance at high temperatures
(e.g around 1000°C) and may be used to to the manufacture of
high-performance creep-resistant turbine blades.

The standard heat treatment of nickel superalloys results in the formation
of Ni3Al cuboidal precipitates (gamma-prime phase) in the nickel alloy
matrix of fcc structure (gamma phase). The superior hgh temperature
performance of the superalloy is attributed to the formation of these
gamma-prime phase structures, which can form more than 60% by volume of the
material [1]. During service, the crystal structure may undergo anisotropic
coarsening, where the gamma-prime phase precipitate is 'rafted' in various
directions [2]; the gamma-prime phase precipitates that have grown in the
tensile direction hinder the movement of creep dislocations and thus
contribute to creep performance.

The nickel-aluminium system is the simplest nickel-based superalloy. In
addition, the alloy performance may be enhanced by alloying with elements
which substitute for nickel and/or aluminium atomic sites and thus change
change the lattice mismatch at the gamma/gamma-prime interfaces [3]. The
activation energy of rafting has been found to be related to the lattice
misfit of the two phases [4], defined by the equation :-

delta = -(alpha(gamma-prime)-alpha(gamma)) / alpha(gamma)

where alpha(gamma-prime) and alpha(gamma) are the lattice constants of the
gamma-prime and gamma phases respectively.

A negative misfit has been found, experimentally, to be favourable for creep
resistance [5,6,7,8]. We may predict, using a neural network model, which
alloying elements favour a negative misfit, so that new alloys may be
designed at minimal cost.

The database used with the neural network consists of :-

   * Lattice constants obtained from X-ray measurements for the two phases,
     and from data books [10,11,12].
   * Alloy compositions, in weight%.

Two alloy groups are used :-

   * Commercial superalloys used in turbine blade manufacture.
   * Experimental superalloys designed to exhibit high creep resistance at
     1000°C (a critical temperature in commercial applications). These
     alloys were developed by Harada et al [9].

The TAR file lattmisfit.tar contains five files. Nickel.misfit.info is an
ASCII text version of this document; the other four files make up the neural
network database as follows :-

   * Nickel.misfit.data.ga contains gamma phase compositions for each alloy.
   * Nickel.misfit.data.gpa contains gamma-prime phase compositions for each
     alloy.
   * Nickel.misfit.data.gb contains gamma phase lattice parameters (in
     Ångstroms) for each alloy.
   * Nickel.misfit.data.gpb contains gamma-prime phase lattice parameters
     (in Ångstroms) for each alloy.

The data in Nickel.misfit.data.ga consist of 17 columns as follows :-

Column 1 is the temperature at which the experiment was conducted, in °C.

Columns 2-17 are compositions (in weight%) of the following elements :-

   * nickel
   * cobalt
   * chromium
   * molybdenum
   * tungsten
   * aluminium
   * titantium
   * niobium
   * tantalum
   * hafnium
   * rhenium
   * vanadium
   * ferrite
   * galium
   * copper
   * gold

The data in Nickel.misfit.data.gpa consists of 15 column as follows :-

Column 1 is the temperature at which the experiment was conducted, in °C.

Columns 2-15 are compositions (in weight%) of the following elements :-

   * nickel
   * cobalt
   * chromium
   * molybdenum
   * tungsten
   * aluminium
   * titanium
   * niobium
   * tantalum
   * hafnium
   * rhenium
   * vanadium
   * ferrite
   * galium

The data in Nickel.misfit.data.gp and Nickel.misfit.data.gpb consist of 1
column, giving the is the lattice constant in Ångstroms for the gamma and
gamm-prime phases respectively of each alloy.
